## Introduction

### MetricStream GRC Platform
MetricStream GRC Platform is the technology infrastructure that modern and digital organizations are relying on to design an integrated GRC architecture that can be embedded into the fabric of the enterprise. Built on cloud-based, open-standard technologies using J2EE and XML architecture, MetricStream GRC Platform enables rapid deployment of GRC Apps that provide a pervasive approach to governance, risk, and compliance. Features of the Platform include: the central GRC Data Model, AppStudio, Infolets, role-based security and access controls, configurable reports and dashboards and risk analytics.

> With a centralized access to risk and compliance data, the GRC Platform provides a social and collaborative user experience improving communication between teams through consistent and closed-loop processes across risk, audit and compliance functions.

### MetricStream Cloud: Designed for GRC
MetricStream is leading the way in enabling companies to deploy GRC apps on the cloud. Built on state-of-the-art virtualization and containerization technologies, the MetricStream GRC Cloud is a fast and easy way to get your GRC apps up and running with optimal reliability, security, and scalability. The GRC Cloud accelerates the deployment of GRC apps, and requires lower investments than traditional on-premise infrastructure.

### AppStudio
MetricStream AppStudio offers a web-based Integrated Development Environment which is a suite of high-level App building blocks, developer tools, system utilities and component libraries for App development, configuration, deployment and maintenance. AppStudio provides the capability to accelerate configuration and management of GRC Apps to meet specific business requirements. This includes the ability to add and modify fields, configure forms, create and configure workflows, reports, dashboards, templates, and business rules. The AppStudio also enables you to extend your Apps for an enterprise wide deployment enabling Pervasive GRC.

### Reporting and Analytics
